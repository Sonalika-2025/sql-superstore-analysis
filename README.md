**SQL Superstore Analysis**
This project focuses on analyzing the Superstore dataset using SQL to uncover business insights related to sales, profit, customers, and trends across regions and categories.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate end-to-end SQL skills including data exploration, performance analysis, trend identification, cumulative calculations, and advanced business reporting.

**Project Highlights**
• Wrote 20 SQL queries  in Microsoft SQL Server
• Explored sales and profit distribution across categories and regions
• Identified top customers and high-performing products
• Analyzed year-over-year growth and monthly sales trends
• Performed cumulative sales and profit calculations
• Segmented data to understand regional and product-level performance
• Delivered business-ready insights

**Key Insights**
• The Technology category consistently delivers the highest profit margins, while Furniture shows lower profitability despite good sales volumes
• West region emerges as the most profitable, while Central region struggles with profit margins
• A small group of loyal customers contribute disproportionately to total revenue
• Discount-heavy orders often lead to reduced profitability, showing the need for a smarter discount strategy
• Year-over-year analysis shows steady growth, but certain sub-categories like Tables are underperforming and dragging profits down

##  How to Run
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and import into SQL Server as `dbo.super_store`.  
2. Open `superstore_sql_analysis.sql` in SSMS.  
3. Run queries individually or all at once.  
4. Review results and insights.

**Next Steps**
I am currently working on building a  Power BI dashboard for this dataset to visualize these insights in an interactive way.
The dashboard will be uploaded here very soon.
